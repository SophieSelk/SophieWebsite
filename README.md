### General Information
This page is intended to display educational background and basic information about who I am as an employee. 
My objective is to show recruiters my website to demonstrate my website design talents and allow them to get in contact wih me. 

### Set Up
Used a Web Static App through Azure Student Version

### Room for Improvement
The next steps:
 1. Adding a Project Gallery with sample code
 2. Creating multipages for Letters of Recommendations and Work Experiences

### What I learned!
This was a great first project to get more infomation about HTML, JavaScript, CSS. 
This is also one of my first time working with Azure and GitHub setting up pipelines for commits.
